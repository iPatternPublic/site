### Abstract

Computational notebooks offer researchers, practitioners, students, and educators the ability to interactively run code and disseminate reproducible workflows that weave together code, visuals, and narratives. This article explores the potential of computational notebooks in urban analytics and planning, demonstrating their utility through a case study of `OSMnx` and its tutorials repository. `OSMnx` is a `Python` package for working with `OpenStreetMap` data and **modeling, analyzing, and visualizing street networks** anywhere in the world. Its official demos and tutorials are distributed as open-source `Jupyter notebooks` on GitHub. This article showcases this resource by documenting the repository and demonstrating OSMnx interactively through a synoptic tutorial adapted from the repository. It illustrates how to download and model street networks for various study sites, compute network indicators, visualize street centrality, calculate routes, and work with other spatial data such as building footprints and points of interest. Computational notebooks can empower guides for introducing methods to new users and can help researchers reach broader audiences interested in learning from, adapting, and remixing their work. Due to their utility and versatility, the ongoing adoption of computational notebooks in urban planning, analytics, and related geocomputation disciplines should continue into the future.
